# hypernovus-puppet
Layer 7 Python Flooding script hypervisor for linux systems, packed with an autoinstaller script.

## Getting Started

soon

### Prerequisites

```sh
sudo su
apt update
apt install -y python2
```

The system requires basically nothing else but hardware. A linux server with 1GB/1Gb/1vCPU does the trick up to 1000 requests/second.



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Single-Command-Installation
   ```sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehmetefeerkan/hypernovus-puppet/main/initl7.sh; chmod +x initl7.sh; ./initl7.sh
   ```
## Usage

  Let's say you want to attack your OWN website 'yourwebsite.com', and you've just set the system up to a server on IP 31.32.33.34; here's how you start an attack:
  ```
  http://31.32.33.34:3000/layer7/yourwebsite.com/10
  ```
