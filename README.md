# hypernovus-puppet
Layer 7 Python Flooding script hypervisor for linux systems, packed with an autoinstaller script.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The system requires basically nothing. A linux server with 1GB/1Gb/1vCPU does the trick up to 1000 requests/second.



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Single-Command-Installation
   ```sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehmetefeerkan/hypernovus-puppet/main/initl7.sh; chmod +x initl7.sh; ./initl7.sh
   ```
## Usage

  Let's say you want to attack your OWN website 'yourwebsite.com', and you've just set the system up to a server on IP 31.32.33.34; here's how you start an attack:
  ```
  http://31.32.33.34:3000/layer7/yourwebsite.com/10
  ```
